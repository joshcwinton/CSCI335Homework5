# CSCI335Homework5

Used code from textbook and slides to create function for finding optimal matrix multiplications.

The number is correct but I haven't figured out what to do with the lastChange array to print the correct order.

To run:
make clean; make all; ./optimal_multiplications dimensions_file1.txt

OR

make clean; make all; ./optimal_multiplications dimensions_file2.txt
